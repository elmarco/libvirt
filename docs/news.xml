          Xen: Support setting CPU features for host-passthrough model

        <description>
          The CPU model presented to Xen HVM domains is equivalent to libvirt's
          host-passthrough model, although individual features can be enabled
          and disabled via the cpuid setting. The libvirt libxl driver now
          supports enabling and disabling individual features of the
          host-passthrough CPU model.

          Libvirt now allows mediated devices to be hot plugged and hot
          unplugged from a guest rather than reporting an error that this isn't

        <description>
          When starting a domain with a disk backed by a device
          mapper volume libvirt also needs to allow the storage
          backing the device mapper in CGroups. In the past
          kernel did not care, but starting from 4.16 CGroups are
          consulted on each access to the device mapper target.

        <description>
          Python is required to build libvirt, and up until now only Python 2
          could be used as an interpreter. All scripts used during build have
          now been made compatible with Python 3, which means both major
          releases of the language are fully supported.

          Xen: Remove hard-coded scheduler weight
        </summary>
        <description>
          The libxl driver was accidentally hard-coding the per-domain
          scheduler weight to 1000, silently ignoring any user-provided
          <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;cputune&gt;</code>. The
          driver now honors <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code>, and defers setting
          a default value to Xen. Note that the Xen default is 256, so any
          domains started after this improvement will have one fourth the
          shares of previously started domains. If all domains must have
          equal CPU shares, administrators must manually set the weight of
          previously started domains to 256, or restart them.

          qemu: TLS migration now enforces use of TLS for the NBD connection
        </summary>
        <description>
          When the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag was used with the migration API libvirt
          did not ensure that the NBD connection was using TLS as well. The code
          now rejects such migration as the TLS transport for NBD is not ready
          yet, but prevents a false sense of security that TLS would be used.
          The support TLS for NBD will be added soon.

          Up until now it was possible to connect to only hypervisor drivers
          (e.g. qemu:///system, lxc:///, vbox:///system, and so on). The
          internal drivers (like network driver, node device driver, etc.) were
          hidden from users and users could use them only indirectly. Starting
          with this release new connection URIs are accepted. For instance
          network:///system, storage:///system and so on.

          Fetching vCPU statistics was very expensive because it lead to waking

          was reworked so that fetching statistics does not wake up halted
          vCPUs.

        <description>
          PCI devices may have other nested capabilities, like SRIOV and mdev
          which depend on the device being plugged into the native vendor
          driver. However, in case such a device is directly assigned to a guest
          using VFIO driver, the device will naturally lose these capabilities
          and libvirt needs to reflect that.

          devices that do not have the disk source specified. Previously such
          devices were silently ignored.

          vbox: Add support for attaching SAS storage controllers
        </summary>
        <description>
          In VirtualBox, SCSI and SAS are distinct controller types whereas
          libvirt does not make such distinction. Therefore, the VBOX driver was
          updated to allow attaching SAS controllers via <code>&lt;controller
              type='scsi' model='lsisas1068'&gt;</code> element. If there are
          both SCSI and SAS controllers present in the VBOX VM, the domain XML
          can associate the disk device using the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>
          element with the <code>controller</code> attribute, and optionally,
          set the port via <code>unit</code> attribute.

          Shareable disks work properly with recent qemu
        </summary>
        <description>
          Recent qemu versions added image locking to avoid potential corruption
          of disk images. This broke shareable disks with libvirt since the
          feature was turned on by default in qemu. Libvirt now enables sharing
          of those disks in qemu so that the image locking is not applied in
          that case. Additionally libvirt now checks that shareable disks have
          supported format (raw) to avoid metadata corruption.

          Instead it properly assigns 'sda' and 'sdb' to those disks in the

          There were some issues with multi-byte domains getting lost
          on daemon restart due to truncation, so the code now handles
          multi-byte names a bit better.

        <description>
          For some time libvirt required qemu capabilities being present when
          parsing VM configs during startup. As a side effect VM configs would
          fail to parse and thus vanish, if the emulator binary would be
          uninstalled or broken. Libvirt now tolerates when capabilities
          are missing during startup.

          It could happen that the link speed for PCIe devices was not
          properly reported or the nodedev-dumpxml just failed. That
          was due to mistake in the field width, but should now work
          properly.

          qemu: Do not report errors on shutdown

        <description>
          For some users, in some rare cases, it could happen that
          there was an error message "internal error: End of file from
          qemu monitor" in the logs even though no problem happened.
          The detection of these false positives was improved and such
          errors should not show any more.

          When error occurred in a specific point in time during the

          was released even though another device was already using
          it, making it possible to hot-plug another device with that
          address, effectively having duplicated addresses in the XML.

          When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the

          this version introduces an event which will be fired when a given
          offset of the storage is written by the hypervisor. Together with the
          API it allows registering thresholds for given storage backing
          volumes and this event will then notify management if the threshold
          is exceeded. Currently only the qemu driver supports this.

          QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor

          approach is suboptimal as in some scenarios with huge amounts of
          guest RAM it can take a minute or more for kernel to allocate and
          zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now flexible and computed by
          libvirt at domain startup.

          bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks
        </summary>
        <description>
          Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks
          directly rather than assigning that to a controller and
          using SATA addresses for disks. It was implemented this way
          because bhyve has no notion of an explicit SATA controller.
          However, as this doesn't match libvirt's understanding of
          disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow
          the common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers
          and SATA addresses for disks. If you're having issues
          because of this, it's recommended to edit the domain's XML
          and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from the &lt;disk&gt;
          elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt
          regenerate it properly.

        <description>
          Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by
          upstream for a long time and the API of 4.0 and newer has
          diverged enough to require code abstractions to handle differences.
          Removing support for those old versions drops lots of code from
          the driver and simplifies the logic to ease implementation of new
          features going forward.

        <description>
          When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to
          provide a place to connect PCI Express endpoint devices,
          libvirt now aggregates multiple root ports together onto the
          same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve slots.
          Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200
          endpoint devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring
          setup of any PCIe switches.
